In pathfinding it's a player to find treasure chest.\r\nIn others it will be PvP battle between players.\r\n\r\n### 01 pathfinding\r\nBasic Astar pathfinding algorithm used to get player to the target - treasure chest.\r\n\r\n### 02 decision\r\nBasic decision tree - building a tree of decisions and actions for player to interact in unknown world.\r\n\r\n### Links\r\n\r\n- [Pathfinding](koressak.github.io/gameai/01_pathfinding)","google":"UA-47492572-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
